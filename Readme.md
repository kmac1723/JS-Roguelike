Tutorial for rot.js library

A Javascript Roguelike game, built using the rot.js library by Ondrej Zara,
and based on the tutorial series by Dominic Charley-Roy.  Uses the sprintf.js
library by Alexandru Marasteanu for the messaging system.

All required packages and licenses (rot.js, sprintf.js) are bundled in the /lib/ directory.

TO PLAY THE GAME:
  Open up main.html in a browser.  There should be a game window with the Javascript
    Roguelike game in it.

    SYMBOLS:
    @ : player character (you!)
    # : Wall
    . : Floor
    < , > : Stairways to next/previous level.
    * , % : Items (rock, apple)
    F , : , B, k : Enemies
    Z : Zombie boss!

    Other items available, such as weapons and armour.

    CONTROLS:
    - Arrow keys to move.
    - Hit < or > to move up or down a level while on a stairway.
    - i to open inventory.
    - , (COMMA) to pick up items.
    - d to drop items.
    - e to eat an edible item.
    - w to wield an equipable item.
    - SHIFT + w to wear a wearable item.
    - ; (SEMICOLON) to examine surroundings (Use arrow keys to move cursor).
    - ? (QUESTION MARK) to open the HELP screen.

    GAMEPLAY "FEATURES":
    - Walls can be tunnelled through by moving into them.
    - Enemies can be attacked by attempting to move into the tile that they occupy.  
    - Enemies except the Fungus (F) can attack the player in a similar way,
        and if the player reaches 0hp, the game is over.
    - When entering a gameover state (e.g. death), the page requires refreshing
        to restart the game.
    - Hunger system, with current hunger state displayed in the bottem left of the
        screen.  Eat regularly to avoid death.
    - Gain experience by killing enemies, and level up you stats!  Enemies also
        get tougher and stronger the further down you go.
    - Boss level!  Defeat the Giant Zombie to complete the game!

NOTE REGARDING TUTORIAL:
  The last update to the series was on November 25, 2013, and apparently has not been
  updated since.  
    The last entry mentions introducing throwing/ranged weapon attacks,
  and refactoring the code to redistribute the entity mixins into separate scripts,
  grouping mixins into packets of related functionality.  So a combat.js script
  would contain all the mixins related to applying damage, while a moves.js script
  contains all mixins that alters an entity's position on the map.
    This could be a good place to start when looking to progress with the project.
